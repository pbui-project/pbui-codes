In this week's episode of the PBUI project, Sam and the Gang rush to get something together.

# Milestone 3!

By Mike 'AndroidKitKat' Eisemann

Hey all, welcome to the third installment of the PBUI project blog. The guys have been hard at work trying to deliver the best possible project for the members of the audience who love a nice cold glass of working Zig code. 

Speaking of working code, we've got it! 

Going over what we promised to deliver from the last meeting...

- [x] Standard library tools (namely a sane and standard way for argument parsing)

- [x] Enhancement of Ziglang documentation and examples
	- [ ] We are in the process of cleaning up our code. We've really been sorta fighting with learning the language, mainly due to a lack of real documentation and a lot of guess work. This is something we hope that our cleaned up source will be good for examples. 

- [x] Have direct communication with Zig contributors 
	- [x] Talk in the Zig IRC channel more
	- [x] Collaborate with Zig contributors on improving our code

I feel we've got a good set of things happening for this Milestone, and as I write this, PBUI-Project team member and Ziglang aficionado Zephan Enciso made a giant breakthrough and got our main binary working. We really appreciate his efforts and all the efforts of the members of the PBUI-Project. Without them, there's no way that this project could have gotten to the state it's in today.

We've got a lot more in the pipeline coming, but here's a sneak preview at what we've got cooked up for this Milestone. More to come soon.

Have you ever wanted a standard way to parse arguments? Has your code ever looked like this:

Well, look no further than [opt.zig](https://github.com/pbui-project/pbui-main/blob/master/include/opt.zig)! It has all the latest features: Flags, arguments, you name it! This library is basically the best thing since canned bread. 

Now, you may be wondering, "Is the PBUI-Project working hard or hardly working?" and to that I say, our efforts have allowed us to birth our latest, greatest, contribution: the PBUI executable. It's lean, it's mean, it's a well oiled machine (don't quote me on that, our review editor, Eamon, thinks that's a short sighted choice of words). This piece of code is so hot that it tried burning Siegfried down at 3 AM. Watch out for any upcoming development, since Serious Sam Battalio is merging out on this code.

That's it for now, I'll keep this blog updated as developments happen.
